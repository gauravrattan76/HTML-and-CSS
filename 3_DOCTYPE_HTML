DOCTYPE-
__________________


<!DOCTYPE html>


Specify which version of html we are using

The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration tells the browser which version of HTML to use and ensures the document is rendered correctly.


Without <!DOCTYPE html>, browsers may switch to Quirks Mode, which can cause inconsistent styling and layout issues.
* With <!DOCTYPE html> → The page renders in Standards Mode (correct, modern rendering).
* Without it → The browser may use Quirks Mode, which mimics old browser behavior and can cause unexpected results.



3. It Ensures Cross-Browser Compatibility
Using <!DOCTYPE html> ensures your webpage behaves consistently across all modern browsers, preventing unpredictable rendering issues.



<!DOCTYPE html>
 <html lang="en"> 
<head> <meta charset="UTF-8"> 
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
 <title>My Web Page</title> 
</head>
 <body>
 <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
 </body>
 </html>
