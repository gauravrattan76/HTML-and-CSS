STANDARD HTML PAGE-
_____________________________________


The <link> element with the rel attribute in HTML is used to define relationships between the current document and external resources. The rel (relationship) attribute specifies the type of connection between them.

STYLESHEET-

<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">

Script-


<script src="script.js" defer></script>


Should have opening and closing tag


No, the <script> tag cannot be self-closing (<script />) because JavaScript code can be placed inside the tag. Even if you are using an external script (src attribute), browsers do not recognize <script /> as valid.


Standard html page-


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css" /></head>
    </head>

            <div class="divOne">div one</div>
            <script src="./script.js"></script>
